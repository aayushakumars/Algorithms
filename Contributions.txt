What is an Algorithm?

A good algorithm can:
- take one or more inputs
- perform some internal calculations or data manipulations
- return one or more outputs
- have minimal side effects.

We want your work to be readable by others; therefore, we encourage you to note the following:

- Please focus hard on naming of functions, classes, and variables. This will help the readers understand easily.
- please avoid single letter names of variables (except iterators)
